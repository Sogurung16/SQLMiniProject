# SQL Mini Project

## Description

Created a mini SQL project to practice and learn the SQL commands with focus around DDL and DML commands by carrying out required tasks. Tasks were grouped in exercises files 1, 2 and 3. Exercise 1 and 3 involved the utilisation of DML commands to manipulate the northwind database.
